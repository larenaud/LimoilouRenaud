abstract: Understanding how spring phenology influences early life can provide important
  insights into drivers of future development and survival. We combined unique, long-term
  data from a bighorn sheep population and satellite-derived phenology indices to
  quantify the relative importance of maternal and environmental influences on milk
  composition and lamb overwinter survival. Based on 216 milk samples from 34 females
  monitored over 6 years, we found that longer snow-free and vegetation growing seasons
  increased milk fatty acid, iron and lactose concentrations. Structural equation
  modelling revealed no causality between milk energy content, lamb weaning mass and
  lamb overwinter survival. Our results suggest that spring conditions can affect
  milk energy content, but we did not detect any effect on lamb overwinter survival
  either directly or indirectly through lamb weaning mass. The effect of green-up
  date on milk composition and energy content suggests that herbivores living in seasonal
  environments, such as the bighorn sheep, might rely on a strategy intermediate between
  ‘capital’ and ‘income’ breeding when energy demands are high.
