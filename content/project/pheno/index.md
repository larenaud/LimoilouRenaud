title: Trophic mismatches in herbivores
summary: Understanding the extent to which changes in phenology match across trophic levels has been one of my main research areas. I used long term data of individually marked [bighorn sheep](https://marco.recherche.usherbrooke.ca/marco.htm) to explore research questions related to reproductive and vegetation phenologies.Artwork by [Impact Media Lab](https://www.impactmedialab.com)
