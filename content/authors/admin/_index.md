My name is Limoilou-Amelie Renaud and I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Maurice-Lamontagne Institute of Fisheries & Oceans Canada, where I work on marine mammal ecology. My first name is pronounced 'LEE-MWA-LOO' and you don't pronounce the 'd' of Renaud ('RE-NO').

I studied animal ecology, finishing my PhD in 2019. I worked as a part-time lecturer in academia, which I loved, while doing my first postdoc. I recently enrolled as a postdoc at a government institution. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LimoilouR) and [GitHub](https://github.com/larenaud).

I currently live in Rimouski, in the province of Québec, Canada, with my partner and my 17-year old cat. In a near future I will be on the quest of a permanent or tenure-track position, either as a research scientist or lecturer.
